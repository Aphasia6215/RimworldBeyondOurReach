        <label>Cosmic Catalyst Fuel Cell</label>
        <description>WARNING: Explosive Superhazard.\n\nThe Cosmic Catalyst Fuel Cell is a small cylinder filled with a reactant for drawing power.\n\nDepending on what it is made of, it can either be filled with Uranium and sunsteel or just pure Cosmic Matter.\n\nThe Cosmic Catalyst Fuel Cell's reaction is safe unless a cell's containment is breached, which would cause the full uncontrolled release of all its energy and a followingly violent explosion.\ntldr; If it's destroyed, often by nearby explosions, it will explode violently.\n\nThe Catalyst Fuel Cell is not vulnerable to fire; it does not combust.\n\nAn explosion can be supermassive if a fully fueled Cosmic Reactor is destroyed by something that also destroys the Catalyst Fuel Cells, like a high-damage explosion. Best keep it somewhere nice and away from mortar fire.</description>
